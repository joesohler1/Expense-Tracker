# Expense-Tracker
This project was specifically made to practice the basics of javaScript and use AI as minimal as possible. What this small CLI app does is input expenses into an array, display those expenses, calculate the total expenses, add/delete them or stop. It will save those objects to a JSON file and call them when ran again in a terminal.
